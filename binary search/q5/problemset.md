Write a c program that impliments a function for binary search.Suppose,
given a sorted integer array containing duplicates, take target input from user then for that input count occurrences . If the element is not found in the array, report that as well. For example:

Input: nums[] = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9] target = 5 
Output: Target 5 occurs 3 times 

Input: nums[] = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]target = 6 
Output: Target 6 occurs 2 times
