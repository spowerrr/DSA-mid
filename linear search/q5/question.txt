Question :
You are given a rotated sorted array of integers arr and an integer target.

 A rotated sorted array is an array that was initially sorted in ascending order but then rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

 Your task is to implement a function find_in_rotated_array in C that searches for the target in the array.

 If the target is found, return the index of its first occurrence.
 
If the target is not found, return -1.
