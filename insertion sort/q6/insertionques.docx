Problem
You have been given an A array consisting of N integers. All the elements in this array are guaranteed to be unique. For each position i in the array A you need to find the position 𝐴[𝑖] should be present in, if the array was a sorted array. You need to find this for each i and print the resulting solution.


Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of array A. The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array A.
Output Format:
Print N space separated integers on a single line , where the ( i )th integer denotes the position of 𝐴[𝑖] if this array were sorted.

Constraints:
1≤𝑁≤100
1≤𝐴[𝑖]≤100


Sample input:                                                                                  Sample output:
5                                                                                                           1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
